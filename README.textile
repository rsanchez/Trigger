h1. :trigger for ExpressionEngine (Beta)

:trigger is a free, open source rapid site development tool for ExpressionEngine 2. :trigger helps you by providing an easy system to automate and easily access the power of EE and EE add-ons.

After toying around with selling Trigger, we have decided to make it open source. We are still working towards a 1.0 and also working on a website for :trigger.

In the mean time, feel free to download it, play around with it, and let us know what you think.
